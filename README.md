A very small [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension that uses Google's convertor.

## Examples

### Currency conversion

Query:
"= $12 in £"

Result: 
"US$ 12 = 7.5 UK£" in Growl

### Units

Query:
"= 10 cm in inch"

Result: 
"10 cm = 9.93 inches" in Growl

## TODO

- copy the result (the right-hand side) to the clipboard
- using an asterisk in the query makes things goes a bit weird
